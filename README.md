iOS Test for Trov

 - Create a simple app that displays some JSON results in a table(data and formatting is your choice). 
 - The network call to retrieve the JSON should be faked (No need to use AFNetworking or NSURLRequest, make a fake class to do this instead). 
 - Show me at least one useful test case.
